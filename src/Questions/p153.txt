Choose the correct answer
A milliammeter with full scale deflection of 10mA has an internal resistance of 5 ohms. It would be converted to an ammeter with a full scale deflection of 1 A by connecting resistance of 
5/99 ohms in series with it	
5/99 ohm in parallel with it 	
99/5 ohm in parallel with it 	
99/5 ohm in  series with it
