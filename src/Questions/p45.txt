Choose the correct answer from a-d
A capacitor and a resistor are connected in series with each other and in series with an accumulator of negligible internal resistance. The potential difference across the terminals of the capacitor is
twice the e.m.f. of the accumulator	
less than the e.m.f. by the potential drop across the resistor	
zero		
the same as the e.m.f.
