Choose the correct answer
In a resonance tube experiment, a tube of fixed length is closed at one end and several tuning forks of increasing frequency used to obtain resonance at the open end. If the tuning fork with the lowest frequency which gave resonance had a  f1 and the next tuning fork to give resonance has a frequency f2 find the ratio f2/f1
