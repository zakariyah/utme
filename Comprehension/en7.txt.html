<p>There are many indicators with which to assess or measure corruption. One of them is the affluent living habit of the public official compared to his/her declared income. Corruption occurs when a public official expects to be induced to perform an act which that public official is or dinarily required to do by law.
<p>Corruption can slow down development. One of the most widely discussed consequences of corruption is the distortion of governmental expenditure. This often results in public money being wasted on white elephant projects, rather than people-oriented services such as health and education. As a result, more opportunities are presented for corrupt use or diversion of funds. Raising the ethical standards of governance can lead to many benefits especially for the economic, political and social development of a country.
<p>Fighting corruption and promoting good governance is therefore crucial to developing an environment that facilitates the social, political and economic development of the people. However, while there are often general statements made about the effect of corruption on poverty and development, there is not an explicit recognition that corruption is more than just wealth misappropriation or abuse of power. Corruption impoverishes countries and deprives their citizens of good governance. It destabilizes economic systems. When organized crime and other illegal activities flourish, basic public functions are eroded and the quality of life of the people is reduced. Bribery, for example, is universally regarded as a crime, but it also reflects socio-economic problems that require broad-based preventive measures, and the involvement of the society at large.
<p>Another implication of global measures against corruption is making government work better by improving the economy. Finally, redesigning political and regulatory structures will reduce corruption and other anti-system players that encourage corrupt practices.
